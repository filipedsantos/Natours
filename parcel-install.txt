1. Installation:
npm install parcel@next --save-dev

2. Then you have to add this piece of code below "main": "app.js", in package.json as shown below, so parcel doesn't bundle into your app.js file.

"main": "app.js",
"targets": {
  "main": false
},

3. Next you need to put the command in scripts part of package.json

"build": "parcel build ./public/js/index.js --dist-dir ./public/js/bundled"

4. Now your script bundled script will have a path ./public/js/bundled/bundle.js, so you need to this line to base.pug:

script(src='/js/bundled/index.js')
